When working with a digital marketing agency like Kulmi Digital, it's essential to provide them with the right access to your Facebook Ad account so they can effectively manage your campaigns. Facebook Business Manager makes it easy to grant access while maintaining full control over your account. Here's a simple guide on how to share access with an agency securely and efficiently.

## Why Grant Access?

Before diving into the steps, it's important to understand why giving access is crucial. By providing your agency with access to your ad account, you allow them to manage and optimize your advertising campaigns without handing over full ownership or sensitive information. The process ensures that both you and the agency remain in control, with transparency in ad performance and financials.

## Steps to Grant Access to Your Facebook Ad Account

### 1. Set Up Facebook Business Manager

If you haven't already, create a Business Manager account. This is the central hub where you manage all your assets, including Pages, ad accounts, and pixels. Visit business.facebook.com to set up your account.

### 2. Add Your Ad Account to Business Manager

If your ad account isn't already in Business Manager, you'll need to add it:

- Go to Business Settings in Business Manager.
- Under "Accounts," select "Ad Accounts."
- Click "Add" and choose the appropriate option, whether you're adding an existing ad account, creating a new one, or requesting access to another account.

### 3. Assign Access to Your Agency

Once your ad account is set up in Business Manager, you can grant access to your agency:

- In Business Settings, navigate to "Partners."
- Click "Add," then "Give a Partner access to your assets."
- Enter your agency's Business Manager ID, which they can provide to you.
- After adding their Business Manager ID, select the assets (such as ad accounts, pages, or pixels) you want to share and define the level of access. For example, if you only want them to manage ads, select "Advertiser" access.

### 4. Set the Appropriate Access Level

It's essential to assign the right access level to your agency based on the tasks they will perform. There are different roles available:

- **Admin Access**: Provides full control, including managing campaigns, assets, and permissions. This is ideal if the agency is handling the entire account on your behalf.
- **Advertiser Access**: Allows the agency to create and manage ads, but they won't have access to financial details or account settings.
- **Analyst Access**: Best for reporting purposes, allowing the agency to view insights without making any changes.

### 5. Confirm and Notify Your Agency

Once you've granted access, inform your agency that they can now manage the account. They'll receive a notification through their Business Manager, and from there, they can begin optimizing your ad campaigns.

## Maintain Control and Monitor Performance

Even though your agency will be managing your Facebook ads, you'll still have full oversight of the campaigns. Through Facebook Business Manager, you can track ad performance, control budgets, and ensure that everything aligns with your goals. Additionally, you can revoke access at any time or adjust permissions if necessary.

## Final Thoughts

By following these steps, you can seamlessly collaborate with a digital marketing agency like Kulmi Digital, allowing them to manage your Facebook ads while keeping full control over your assets. This partnership ensures that your campaigns are in expert hands without compromising the security and privacy of your account.
